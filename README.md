# FrontBase

This template was built to serve as a template for a JavaScript es6 component. It offers a a js and scss bundling process (webpack), a test instrastructure (based on Jasmine and Karma), a documentation generator all set up (jsDoc) and a html demo page that loads the newly created component.

It works on both Windows and Unix based system ; on Windows, double click the `init.bat` file and on Unix systems, run the `init.sh` script to set up the component environement.
